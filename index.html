        <div class="Title">About</div>
        <div id="About">  
            <p>Bacem Ghazaoui,29, from Tunisia, I was graduated as an Architect from the National School of Architecture and Urbanism, in Tunisia from June 2019 and a Certified Autodesk Revit Professional.As a creative and highly motivated architect with 4+ years of experience in the field, I am passionate about designing sustainable and functional buildings that enhance the lives of those who use them. With a strong background in several architectural projects, I am able to approach projects from multiple perspectives and create innovative solutions that meet the specific needs of each client.</p>
            <p>I have experience in all phases of the design process, from initial concept development to construction administration. I am proficient in AutoCAD, Sketchup, and Revit and have a deep understanding of building codes and regulations. </p>
            <p>In addition to my technical skills, I am a strong communicator and team player. I am able to effectively collaborate with other professionals, including engineers and contractors, to ensure that projects are completed on time and within budget. I am always eager to take on new challenges and continue learning and growing.</p> 
            <p>Since I was young I was always designing blogs, websites about my passions and sharing my opinions with other people. I have rediscovered my passion of developing websites and decided to move on with learning in more depth web development. Starting March 2023 I'm taking a Javascript Fullstack Bootcamp with GoMyCode.</p> 
            <p>As a first thought, you may think Architecture and web development are two separate fields but as Steve Jobs once said "Design is not just what it looks like and feels like. Design is how it works."This quote highlights the importance of functionality in design, including in the fields of architecture and web development. In all two fields it's crucial to consider not only the appearance of the final product, but also its practicality and effectiveness in achieving the desired outcomes. A well-designed building, marketing campaign, or website should not only look good, but also work well for the people using it.</p>
